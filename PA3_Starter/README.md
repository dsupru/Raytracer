Included are the executable, and 2 screenshots of unique scenes.

As for video/animation, I don't have enough time left to do those.
If possible, I would like to submit that separately.

Out of the core project requirements, everything works perfectly except refraction.
With refraction, I have some minor issue. 
I implemented formulas from the book, spending days on trying to get it to work (that's why actually I didn't have time left for animation).

I made changes to scene.cpp, .hpp, triangle and sphere classes.
The program input methods are the same.
2 new ray files are:
- twoMirrorsOnAnotherMirror.ray
- mirrorOnABoard.ray

It was previously the case that the precise changes needed to be specified.
Just in case, I am also including a git diff file that lists those.
